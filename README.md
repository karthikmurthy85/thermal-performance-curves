# thermal-performance-curve (TCPs)

Analyze the thermal performance curves of vegetation using global long-term NDVI data

Apply Sharpe-schoolfield equation to fit the thermal performance properties

Analyse the spatial and temporal variation in Topt with respect to ambient air temperature

Analyse the width of the TCPs or the thermal safety margins
